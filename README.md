## Requirements
| Component             | What it is          | Where it's used               |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| xfwm4                 | Window manager.     | Self-explanatory.             |
| [lemonbar-xft](https://github.com/drscream/lemonbar-xft) | Bar. | Self-explanatory. |
| pulseaudio            | Sound server.       | The system tray opens pavucontrol when the speaker icon is clicked on. This should be present on your setup anyway. |
| NetworkManager        | Network connection manager. | Again, the system tray needs this. It also should be present anyway for easy configuration of network devices. |
| [spotify-cli-linux](https://github.com/pwittchen/spotify-cli-linux) | Command-line interface for Spotify. | The system tray uses this to control Spotify without going through its actual interface. |
| [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) | Icon font family. | System tray icons. |
